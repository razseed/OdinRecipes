    <h3 class="title2">Traditional Sunday Roast</h3>
    <p>This is my own personal version of a Sunday Roast and sure to be a massive hit with loved ones</p>
    <h4 class="title3">Ingredients you'll need</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>300g Potatoes</li>
        <li>1 Chicken</li>
        <li>500g Carrots</li>
        <li>300g Parsnips </li>
        <li>200g Sage and Onion stuffing</li>
        <li>2 per person Yorkshire puddings </li>
        <li>200gGreen pea's</li>
        <li>Chicken Gravy</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        <li>1 Lemon</li>

    </ul>
    <h4 class="title3">How to prepare</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by checking the chicken is free of giblets, then take your lemon and pierce it several times with a fork, then push it into the cavity, if the cavity is larger, 
                add additional lemons.
            </li>
            <li>Next find the neck skin and open it out above the breast meat (careful not to tear it!) and stuff with the sage and onion stuffing before tucking the neck skin back under the body,
                season the skin now quite generously , this will help crispen the skin.
            </li>
            <li>Now take your potatoes, wash and peel them, and slice into triangles. Boil for 15 minutes before removing from plain water and place them into a well oiled roasting tray
                season generously again to help develop an irresistable skin (make sure they are all lightly coated in oil before adding salt and pepper) </li>
            <li>At this stage we have a chicken and potatoes trayed up ready for the oven, we will need to peel wash and chop our carrots and parsnips </li>
            <li>Roast the chicken and the potatoes for about 40 minutes, rebasting with fat from the chicken every 20 minutes, after this time add your parsnips and carrots chopped and washed into the roasting
                tray holding the chicken and continue to roast for another 40 minutes, rebasting again every 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>in the last 20 minutes before serving time, we will make our gravy and boil our pea's simply add boiling water to your chicken gravy and gently simmer stirring occasionally</li>
            <li>in a seperate pot add peas to boiled water and add 1 tsp of sugar this will help greatly in bringing out their wonderful flavour, if like me you bought yorkshire puddings(aunt bessies are a treat)
                pop them in with the potatoes now.
            </li>
            <li>Last but not least, <b>ENJOY!</b></li>
        </ol>
