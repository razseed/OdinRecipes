        <li>Chicken Gravy</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        <li>1 Lemon</li>

    </ul>
    <h4>How to prepare</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by checking the chicken is free of giblets, then take your lemon and pierce it several times with a fork, then push it into the cavity, if the cavity is larger, 
                add additional lemons.
            </li>
            <li>Next find the neck skin and open it out above the breast meat (careful not to tear it!) and stuff with the sage and onion stuffing before tucking the neck skin back under the body,
                season the skin now quite generously , this will help crispen the skin.
            </li>
            <li>Now take your potatoes, wash and peel them, and slice into triangles. Boil for 15 minutes before removing from plain water and place them into a well oiled roasting tray
                season generously again to help develop an irresistable skin (make sure they are all lightly coated in oil before adding salt and pepper) </li>
            <li>At this stage we have a chicken and potatoes trayed up ready for the oven, we will need to peel wash and chop our carrots and parsnips </li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
        </ol>
